# sar_process_management-tool
python code for checking SAR progress
The company I worked for queries 26 systems for the purpose of GDPR Subject Access Requests. 
We create a search summary sheet for each subject and proceed to do data searches on each system
This code aggregates all the open templates on one google sheet so that the process managers
can get an instant overview of what has been done and what is left to be done
